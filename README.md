## Installation

To install the back end, open the command prompt to the project's root directory. Then, type `npm install`. Once the process has completed, go into the `client` folder and type `npm install` again. This will install the React front end application.

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. Start the Express app by typing `PORT=3001 node bin/www` in your terminal. If you are using Windows, type `set PORT=3001 && node bin/www` instead. If the launch is successful, the message "Connected to the database." will be printed.

2. Start the React app by opening up a new terminal to the nested `client` folder, and run `npm start`. You can then open the application by typing `http://localhost:3000/` into the web browser of your choice.
